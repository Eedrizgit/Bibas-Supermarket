# Data
Data Source: The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, a widely recognized platform for open-source datasets, providing structured sales data relevant to a supermarket.

Branch, City, Customer, Gender, Product line, Date, Payment type, Unit price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Cogs (Cost of goods sold), Gross margin percentage, Gross income, Ratings

Data Cleaning: The dataset required minimal preprocessing, as it was well-structured with few missing values, no duplicates, or inconsistencies. The few modifications involved formatting column headings for consistency and clarity.

# In-Analysis observations

1. The Giza branch performed the best in the first quarter, generating a total gross income of $5,265.
2. The Cairo and Alexandria branches each recorded a total gross income of $5,057.
3. The Health and Beauty category had the lowest number of units sold.

5. The highest number of units sold were transacted through E-wallet, totaling 345.
6. January was the best-performing month of the first quarter, with a gross income of $5,537.

# In analysis recommendations

1. I recommend launching sales promotions for Health and Beauty products to increase awareness and drive demand.
2. Since the online sales channel accounted for the highest number of units sold, we should avoid investing in new physical outlets.
3. Stakeholders should maintain the current outlets and focus on boosting online sales through targeted promotions.
4. A general sales promotion should be planned for the upcoming quarter to stimulate overall sales growth.
5. I recommend that stakeholders instruct all inventory staff to closely monitor stock levels in the coming year to prevent product shortages.
